Callback Functions - A function that is passed into another function as an arguement. Can be called for each item in an array and run. Preferred over the for loop.

Closure - A function returned in a function remembers where the call came from and can access other function and variables availble to the parent function.

arguments array - Used to iterate or look at unknown number of given arguments.

recursion - Another way to iterate. A function that can call itself within itself.

prototype - Passes in one function that can be used in multiple individual functions rather than each individual function having and running it's own function.

constructors - A template function that is passed in to create and return an object.
